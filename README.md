# cranberryjuice-recipes

This is the code for a website that uses are.na as a simple cms. It's heavily inspired on the project "arena-basal", a project you can find here: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/arena-basal?path=index.html%3A1%3A0. If you are interested in knowing more about this specific project and how it's code works, you can contact me via info[at]mariavandertogt.com. I'd be happy to help you addapt it for your own projects. I've added notes to explain how the code work in the bylines. 

The website was made to accompany the publication "HOW TO HEAL?", made by Cranberry Juice in collaboration with Bring Your Own Book. 

HOW TO HEAL? aims to act as an archive of recipes, remedies, and DIY healing methods to show that next to the institutionalised medical field, there are still those who have to seek healing and treatments for themselves and loved
ones through alternative routes. Not to replace or diminish, but to move alongside and think forward the developments and frameworks of medicine and care today. We aspire to continue this archive both in print and online, ensuring widespread accessibility to its evolving content. Feel free to add your own recipes and DIY healing treatments via the public are.na channel How to Heal https://www.are.na/cranberry-juice/how-to-heal-qauyz1gmw7e.
